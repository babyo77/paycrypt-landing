            Paycrypt ("we", "us", "our") provides a global cryptocurrency
            payment gateway headquartered in India. These Terms of Service
            ("Terms") govern your access to and use of Paycrypt's platform and
            related services. By registering for or using Paycrypt (the
            "Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not
            agree, do not use the Service. Paycrypt operates worldwide, but use
            of the Service must comply with applicable local laws; users
            accessing Paycrypt from other jurisdictions do so at their own
            initiative and are responsible for compliance with their local laws.
            All legal matters under these Terms are governed by Indian law, as
            set forth below.

            To use Paycrypt, you must meet our eligibility criteria. You must be
            at least 18 years old (or older if required by your local
            jurisdiction) and have the legal capacity to enter into contracts.
            If you use Paycrypt on behalf of a company or other legal entity,
            you represent that you have authority to bind that entity. Paycrypt
            reserves the right to refuse service, cancel orders, or terminate
            accounts that do not meet these eligibility requirements or that we
            otherwise deem unsuitable.

            Paycrypt enables businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments via
            online integration. Merchants can integrate Paycrypt into their
            websites or platforms by using our payment widget, or by generating
            and sharing cryptocurrency payment invoices. In practice, a
            cryptocurrency payment gateway is a business-to-business service
            that helps one business accept cryptocurrency as payment. Our
            Service currently supports payments and payouts in cryptocurrencies
            only; fiat currency payouts are not available at this time (but may
            be added in a future phase). When you receive funds through
            Paycrypt, settlement is made in the cryptocurrency you select. You
            acknowledge and agree that Paycrypt is not a bank, exchange, or
            wallet provider â€“ we only facilitate transfers of cryptocurrency
            between parties.

              their site or app.

              Crypto Payouts: Merchant settlements are paid out in

            To use Paycrypt's merchant features (such as creating payment links

            accurate, complete information. You are responsible for maintaining
            the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all
            activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify
            Paycrypt immediately if you suspect any unauthorized use of your
            account. We may suspend or terminate accounts that contain false,
            incomplete, or misleading information, or that we reasonably suspect
            are being used in violation of these Terms. Paycrypt is not
            responsible for losses resulting from unauthorized access to your
            account or any actions taken by anyone using your account with or

            Paycrypt may request Know Your Customer (KYC) information (such as
            identification documents) to comply with applicable laws and
            regulations (including anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism
            financing laws). We will comply with all applicable laws, rules, and
            regulations, and we may verify user identities or transaction
            information as required. However, KYC is not required for basic use
            of the Service and non-KYC users may continue using Paycrypt without
            limitation. If we request additional verification for compliance or
            security reasons and you choose not to provide it, we may limit or
            suspend certain features of your account. In all cases, you must
            provide true, accurate, and up-to-date information when requested.

            right to change fees at any time without prior notice. Your
            continued use of the Service after a fee change will constitute your
            acceptance of the new fees.

              Settlement Currency: All merchant payouts are made in
              cryptocurrency. You cannot receive settlement in fiat currency at
              this time. You bear the risk of any exchange rate fluctuations or
              volatility in the chosen cryptocurrency. For example, if you
              choose to settle in Bitcoin, you assume the volatility risk of

              effective upon posting, and your continued use of the Service will

            that by their nature should survive (such as Intellectual Property,
            Disclaimers, Limitation of Liability, Indemnification, Governing
            Law, and Contact Information) will continue in effect even after
            termination. You may terminate your Paycrypt account at any time by
            contacting us or by discontinuing use of the Service.
